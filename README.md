## INTRO

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Supriya, and this is my portfolio project - web application called Connect-Happiness. Please notice, this is MVP, not a final version. I implemented the most important features, rest will be added in the future.

### What this app about?

It is about local people helping their neighbours to enjoy a better quality of life. Connect_Happiness help create an environment where people feel safe and secure because they have genuine connection with one another,they are aimed primarily at helping elderly, disabled, vulnerable, frail or isolated people.

### What this app does?

This App allows senior citizens to ask help from volunteer's for shopping assistance or clean the garden,etc .
It also allows seniorCitizens to organise events to which other people can join.

### App Demo
